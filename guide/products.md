# Products

Products are anything a company sellsâ€”whether physical items, digital products, or services. In retail, you'll often hear products called consumer goods or merchandise. Retailers choose their merchandise based on market demand and what their customers want, from everyday essentials to luxury items.

Manufacturers use the term "product" for both the raw materials they buy for production and the finished goods they sell. These two sides of commerce take different approaches to product development and marketing to succeed. We have plans to add manufacturing related features but at the moment SMA might not have much for manufacturing use. Please try the live demo to check if the feature you need already added in the Stock Manager Advance.

## Stock Count

The stock count is the physical verification of the quantities and condition of items held in an inventory or store. Stock count may be performed as an intensive annual end of year procedure or may be done continuously by means of a cycle count. An annual end of year stock count is typically done for use in a company's financial statements.

Once count has been completed, you can add adjustment to update your current stock.

## Brands & Categories

The brands and categories are used to group the products. Organizing your online store by product type helps customers find what they need faster, makes your promotions more compelling, and drives sales.
