# Point of Sale

Point of Sale (POS) has Simple and Modern designs, you can choose it in the POS Settings. Both offer the same functionality with different design. POS has registers, virtual keyboard (soon), hold/suspend orders, customer screen to display order details to customers and quick cash buttons.

The top bar has search products/scan barcode input with sell gift card button, Customer View (table icon), Sales, Cash Register, Open Orders, POS Settings and User menus.

### Multiple Payment

POS can accept multiple payments. If the amount is less then payable then the modal will display `Add Another Payment` button. Once the total amount is equal to payable the button will hide.
